In this file we will cluster our users according to their proir patterns. We will use the dimensions nu.ratings (number of ratings per user), IPT and Variety Seeking. 
The Idea is, to Cluster the users per Continent(we assume that the majority of consumed beers origin from the drinkers home continent). 
Variety Seeking is a measure that represents the number of unique different styles divided by the total number of rated beers.
